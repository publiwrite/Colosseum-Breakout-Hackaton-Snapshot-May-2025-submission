# Publiwrite Frontend Monorepo

## How to run the apps locally

**Pre-reqs:**

- Node version 18+

**Locations of apps:**

- localhost:4205 -> Rights project

To start all apps locally run the following command at the root of `pw-fe-monorepo`

```
npm start
```

You can run individual apps one at the time using the following commands at the root of `pw-fe-monorepo`

```
npm run start:rights
```

**Development requirements:**

To get the latest types from GraphQL server;

```
npm run graphql:codegen
```

This will enable file watcher and whenever a graphql query changes done, it'll automatically get the latest types into code.

--------------------------------------------- Tested until here

## How to build the apps

Apps can be built individually using the following commands at the root of `pw-fe-monorepo`

```
npm run build:rights
```

## How to run locally within docker containers

### Running all apps at once

You can run all apps locally within containers using the following command at the root of `pw-fe-monorepo`

```
docker-compose up
```

_Note:_ For this to work you need to have the docker daemon running

You can also run them in detached mode using the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the running containers you can simply do:

```
docker-compose down
```

You can access the apps that are running in container on the following links:

- localhost:4205 -> Rights project

### Running individual apps

You can also run each app individually in docker containers. To do this you must firstly build the image for the app you want to run and then start the container based on the image you built.
_Note:_ for the following to work you need to have the docker daemon running

Here are the commands for building the images - Again, run them at the root of `pw-fe-monorepo`

```
docker build -t pw-auth-fe-app-image -f ./apps/auth/Dockerfile .
docker build -t pw-marketplace-fe-app-image -f ./apps/marketplace/Dockerfile .
docker build -t pw-dashboard-fe-app-image -f ./apps/dashboard/Dockerfile .
docker build -t pw-collaborative-editor-fe-app-image -f ./apps/collaborative-editor/Dockerfile .

```

Here are the commands for running the apps once the images have been successfully build

```
docker run -p 4200:4200 --env-file .env.local pw-auth-fe-app-image
docker run -p 4202:4202 --env-file .env.local pw-marketplace-fe-app-image
docker run -p 4201:4201 --env-file .env.local pw-dashboard-fe-app-image
docker run -p 4203:4203 --env-file .env.local pw-collaborative-editor-fe-app-image
```

## Old docs from repo set-up - TO BE REMOVED AT ONE POINT

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve pw-fe-monorepo`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
